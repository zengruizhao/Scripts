Simple decision trees wrapper class for the c4.5 classes. These files 
provide an easy and fast method to run some simple tests with decision
trees from matlab in windows. These files automate the process of 
creating and testing the files. Sadly, no predictions are returned, 
but some data that can be used to generate statistics is obtained.
