# FROC: Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic curve

This python script computes and plots a FROC curve - Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic - from numpy arrays. <br />
FROC curve is an alternative to ROC curve. On the x-axis stands the average number of false positives (FP) per scan instead of the false positive rate (FP/N, with N number of negatives). This plot is particularly useful for unbalanced detection problems, where the number of positives P is significantly lower than N. This would result in sticking all the meaningful information to the left of a ROC curve plot, and make any interpretation difficult.
